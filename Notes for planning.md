Struggles
Successes
What would I do different?
Manage your time well? 
Planning good enough?


See the project zero spec needs. 

The wire-framing can help with the html and css.

Will be running the browser.  DOM manipulation. 

Turn based-  a NPC and a Player. 

Show visually, the winner.

Logic is most important.  Then clean 

Deploy game online-  on Friday. 

State changes-  
complexities. 

What is the MVP?  The minimum viable product. 
-  Agreed MVP come Monday. 

Learning project— code practice. 


User stories for flow of the game. 

Research animations-  if wanted to, and show understanding on Monday. 

Needs:
User stories- ex:  user clicks go.  “Round starts”

Milestones- checkpoints-  
M-th
1. Setup
	a. Building deck class
2. Player class
    1. Interact with the deck class
3. Visualize on the DOM
4. Cleanup and final visuals.

Know if you are ahead or behind on the milestones. 

Wireframes:
What does the start look like?  
1. Start button
    1. With click image.
2. The next screen.. 
    1. Dealers cards on screen.  General ideas. 

The Pitch!
What is my MVP?  A paragraph on this. 

“I’m going to build blackjack.  Me and CPU.  Hitting passing. Player will select hit or hold, and handling the logic of bust.. etc. 
-  This is what will be expected on the final build.
