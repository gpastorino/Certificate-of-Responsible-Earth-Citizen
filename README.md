Plastics Recycling Program/Game:

Layout: 
There will be a key for each plastics type for the user to see what is what (located at the right on the screen). The user needs to match each plastic with the right plastic symbol.  They get to practice matching each plastic to each symbol as a tutorial.
Once all of the items are matched, the game Play Button appears.

Once the user hits play, the plastic parts will start to fall.  

Different pictures of plastics fall down from the top of the screen. As the game progresses the rate that the plastic pieces appear increases over time. 

At the end of the minute, the remaining pieces continue to fall, to let the user sort them out, and for the game to complete.  

Specifics about the bins:  
There are bins at the bottom of the screen that the user drags the plastic pictures into.
Each of the plastic bins are labeled with a specific plastics symbol.  


Scoring:  
The user will get a score for each correct sorting of the plastic. 
If they sort a plastic wrong, they will get a dock.  If they get hit with 3 docks then it’s game over.  (GAME OVER SIGN)
They are timed to get as many as they can in a minute. 

If they don’t sort a plastic it passes by.  A total of 200 pieces will fall in the minute timeframe. 


If they score above 90% they will get a “Certificate of Responsible Earth Citizen”
- They should get a print option for their certificate. 
If the user doesn’t get 90%, and the game has ended, they will be prompted with the Play Button again. 

Note: Instructions listed: Trash piece key
